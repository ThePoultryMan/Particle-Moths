# Particle Moths

Adds moths to Minecraft using particles.

## Spawning
Moths don't technically spawn because they're actually particles. However, for the sake of simplicity I will refer to this "adding of particles" as spawning.

### Caves
Moths will attempt to spawn in a radius around the player, with the size being defined in the config. If the place where moths attempt to spawn has rain or is in water, then the moths won't spawn.

### Blocks
Moths also have a chance to spawn by certain light-emitting blocks. Similarly to the cave spawning, if a moth tries to spawn in rain or water, it won't be spawned.
